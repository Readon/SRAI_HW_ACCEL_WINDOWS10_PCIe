# SRAI_HW_ACCEL_WINDOWS10_PCIe
PCIe based accelerator for VCU1525  with xDMA based on Windows10 and Windows Server 2016 development environment
Makefiles will not work directly on Windows10 as these were built for Linux.
Use manual  execution of all the various TCL files as needed  for building on Windows10 for now.
Windows10 Makefile like automated build will be comming soon.
